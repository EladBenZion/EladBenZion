# 👋 Hi, I’m Elad Ben Zion

🚀 Youngest cybersecurity expert in Israel (age 15) — and one of the most advanced in the world in my age group.

I earned that title not by watching from the sidelines, but by **building real tools**, **winning national competitions**, and earning the **industry's toughest certifications** — all before I turned 16.

## 🧠 About Me

I started in tech at age 11, building full-stack apps while most kids were still learning basic math.  
By 13, I was exploiting live networks, writing my own security tools, and mastering advanced penetration testing.  
That same year, I **took 1st place at a national hackathon** hosted at Oracle HQ, beating 100+ teams — most aged 16–18 — with my platform **E-Questions**. I returned the following year and won again — this time with **E-Volunteers**.

Today, I build **high-impact offensive tools**, write **custom exploits**, and automate everything from **initial recon to post-exploitation**.  
I’ve built over **100 full-stack and red teaming projects** across areas like **WiFi pentesting**, **cloud security tools**, **Docker security**, **AppSec automation**, **exploit frameworks**, **AI-assisted breach simulation**, and **cloud misconfiguration detection**.

I’m a **software engineer who writes code like a weapon** — combining red teaming, reverse engineering, breach automation, and cloud defense into production-grade tooling that exposes what others miss.
